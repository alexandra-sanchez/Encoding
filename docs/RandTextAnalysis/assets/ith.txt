Lights up on Washington Heights
                     Up at the break of day
                     I wake up and I got this little punk I gotta chase away
                     Pop the grate at the crack of dawn
                     Sing while I wipe down the awning
                     Hey y'all good morning
                     I am Usnavi and you prob'ly never heard my name
                     Reports of my fame are greatly exaggerated
                     Exacerbated by the fact that my syntax is highly complicated cause
                     I emigrated from the single greatest little place in the Caribbean
                     Dominican
                     Republic
                     I love it
                     Jesus, I'm jealous of it
                     And beyond that
                     Ever since my folks passed on I haven't gone back
                     Goddamn,
                     I gotta get home then
                     I'm gonna test ya later
                     I'm getting tested times are tough on this bodega
                     Two months ago somebody bought Ortega's Our
                     Neighbors started packin' up and pickin' up
                     And ever since the rent's went up
                     It's gotten mad expensive
                     But we live with just enough
                     In the heights
                     I can't survive without café
                     I serve café
                     Cuz tonight seems like a million years away!
                     En Washington—
                     Me and my cousin runnin' just another
                     Dime-a-dozen
                     Mom-and-pop stop-and-shop
                     And, oh my god,
                     It's gotten too darn hot like my man Cole Porter said
                     People come
                     Through for a few cold waters and
                     A lottery ticket,
                     Just a part of the routine
                     Everybody's got a job;
                     Everybody's got a dream
                     They gossip,
                     As I sip my coffee and smirk
                     The first stop as people hop to work
                     Bust it— I'm like— One dollar, two
                     Dollars, one fifty, one sixty-nine I got it
                     You want a box of condoms what kind?
                     That's two quarters Two quarter waters
                     The New York Times
                     You need a bag for that?
                     The tax is added
                     Once you get some practice at it
                     You do rapid
                     Mathematics automatically
                     Sellin' maxipads and fuzzy dice for taxicabs and practically
                     Everybody's stressed, yes,
                     But they press through the mess
                     Bounce checks and wonder what's next
                     In the heights I buy my coffee and I go
                     I buy my coffee and—
                     Set my sights
                     On only what I need to know
                     What I need to know—
                     In the heights Money is tight
                     But even so—
                     Even so—
                     When the lights go down I blast my radio!
                     En Washington
                     Yeah, I'm a streetlight,
                     Choking on the heat The world spins around while I'm frozen to my
                     Seat The people that I know all keep on rolling down the street But
                     Every day is different so I'm switchin' up the beat Cuz my parents
                     Came with nothing They got a little more And sure, we're poor, but yo
                     At least we got the store And it's all about the legacy they left
                     With me, it's destiny And one day I'll be on a beach with Sonny
                     Writing checks to me In the heights I hang my flag up on display We
                     Came to work and to live and we got a lot in
                     Common It reminds me that I came from miles away D
                     R., P
                     R., we are not stoppin'
                     In the heights
                     Every day, paciencia ye fe
                     Until the day we go from poverty to stock options
                     In the heights I've got today
                     And today's all we got,
                     So we cannot stop This is our block In the heights I
                     Hang my flag up on display Lo le lo le lo lai lai lo le!
                     It reminds me that I came from miles away!
                     My family came from miles away— In the heights It gets more expensive
                     Every day Every day And tonight is so far away—
                     But as for mañana, mi pana Ya gotta just keep watchin'
                     You'll see the Late nights You'll taste Beans and rice The syrups and
                     Shaved ice I ain't gonna Say it twice So turn up the stage lights
                     We're takin' a flight To a couple
                     Of days In the life of what it's like
                     En Washington Heights!

Sigue andando el camino por toda su vida
                     Respira
                     Breathe
                     Y si pierdes mis huellas que dios te bendiga
                     Respira
                     This is my street
                     I smile at the faces I've known all my life
                     They regard me with pride
                     And everyone's sweet
                     They say, "You're going places!"
                     So how can I say that while I was away, I had so much to hide!
                     Hey guys, it's me!
                     The biggest disappointment you know
                     The kid couldn't hack it, she's back and she's walkin real slow
                     Welcome home
                     Just breathe
                     Sigue andando el camino por toda su vida.
                     Respira
                     Just breathe
                     Y si pierdes mis huellas que dios te bendiga.
                     Respira
                     As the radio plays old forgotten boleros
                     I think of the days when this city was mine
                     I remember the praise
                     Ay, te adoro, te quiero
                     The neighborhood waved, and said
                     Nina, be brave, and you're gonna be fine
                     And maybe it's me
                     But it seems like lifetimes ago
                     So what do I say to these faces that I used to know?
                     "Hey, I'm home?"
                     Mira, Nina
                     Hey
                     No me preocupo por ella
                     They're not worried about me
                     Mira, alli esta nuestra estrella
                     They are all counting on me to succeed
                     I am the one who made it out
                     The one who always made the grade
                     But maybe I should've just stayed home...
                     When I was a child I stayed wide awake, climbed to the highest place
                     On every fire escape, restless to climb
                     (Underneath Nina (above)) Ella si da la talla
                     Repira
                     I got every scholarship
                     Saved every dollar
                     The first to go to college
                     How do I tell them why
                     I'm coming back home
                     With my eyes on the horizon
                     Just me and the GWB
                     Asking 'Gee Nina, what'll you be?'
                     Straighten the spine
                     Smile for the neighbors
                     Everything's fine
                     Everything's cool
                     The standard reply
                     "Lots of tests, lots of papers"
                     Smile, wave goodbye
                     And pray to the sky, Oh, God -
                     What will my parents say?
                     Nina
                     Can I go in there and say
                     Nina
                     "I know that I'm letting you down..."
                     Nina...
                     Just breathe...

                     There's a traffic accident I have to mention
                     At the intersection of 10th Ave and the Jacob Javitz Convention Center
                     And check it, don't get stuck in the rubber-neckin'

                     Hello!
                     Good morning!
                     I better find my folks
                     Thanks for the welcome wagon
                     Anytime. Anytime, Nina
                     Wait here with me
                     It's getting hot outside, turn up the A.C
                     Stay here with me


The elevated train by my window
                     Doesn't faze me anymore
                     The rattling screams don't disrupt my dreams
                     It's a lullaby, in its way
                     The elevated train drives everyone insane
                     But I don't mind, oh no
                     When I bring back boys they can't tolerate the noise
                     And that's okay, 'cause I never let them stay
                     And one day, I'm hoppin' that elevated train and I'm riding away!
                     It won't be long now!
                     The boys around the way holler at me when I'm walking down the street
                     Their machismo pride doesn't break my stride—
                     It's a compliment, so they say
                     The boys around the way holler at me every day but I don't mind, oh no
                     If I'm in the mood, it will not be with some dude
                     Who is whistling 'cause he has nothing to say
                     Or who's honking at me from his Chevrolet!
                     And one day... I'm hoppin' in a limousine and I'm driving away!
                     It won't be long now!
                     Ay, Usnavi, help! SOS!
                     Good morning, Vanessa!
                     If it isn't the loveliest girl in the place...
                     You've got some schmutz on your face
                     Good morning!
                     Good morning!
                     Vanessa!
                     Vanessa!
                     Vanessa!
                     VANESSSSSAAAAAA! I'm thirsty, coño!
                     Can I get a Pepsi and some packing tape?
                     Uh, my cousin over there with his tongue hanging out, has been meaning to ask you...
                     Yes?
                     What a lady such as yourself might be doing tonight?
                     Does your cousin dance?
                     Like a drunk Chita Rivera.
                     Okay... After Nina's dinner, we can hit a few clubs and check out the fireworks...
                     Oh snap! Who's that?
                     Don't touch me, I'm too hot! Yes!
                     Qué pasó? Here I go!
                     So dope! Y tu lo sabes!
                     No pare
                     Sigue sigue!
                     Did you see me?
                     Freaky freakit!
                     What a way to begin the weekend
                     Sonny, anything you want is free, man!
                     And my dearly beloved Dominican Republic
                     I haven't forgotten
                     You!
                     Gonna see this honey, make a little money
                     And one day I'll hop Jet
                     Blue!
                     But until that fateful day, I'm grateful
                     I got a destination
                     I'm runnin' to make it home
                     And home's what Vanessa's runnin' away from!
                     I'm runnin' to make it home
                     And home's what Vanessa's runnin' away from...
                     The neighborhood salon is the place I am working for the moment
                     As I cut their hair, ladies talk and share—
                     Every day, who's doin' who and why...
                     The neighborhood salon doesn't pay me what I wanna be making but I don't mind
                     As I sweep the curb I can hear those turbo engines blazing a trail through the sky
                     I look up and think about the years gone by
                     But one day—I'm walkin' to JFK and I'm gonna fly!
                     It won't be long now!
                     Any day

This isn't happening
                     Inutil.
                     Useless.
                     Just like my father was before me
                     Inutil.
                     Useless.
                     And everyday he cut the cane
                     He came home late and prayed for rain, prayed for rain
                     And on those days when nothing came
                     My father's face was lined with shame
                     He'd sit me down beside him and he'd say,
                     "My father was a farmer,
                     His father was a farmer,
                     And you will be a farmer."
                     But I told him,
                     "Papi, I'm sorry, I'm going farther.
                     I'm getting on a plane
                     And I'm gonna change the world someday."
                     And he slapped my face
                     He stood there, staring at me
                     Useless.
                     Today my daughter's home and I am
                     Useless
                     And as a baby she amazed me with the things she learned each day
                     She used to stay on the fire escape while all the other kids would play
                     And I would stand beside her and I'd say,
                     "I'm proud to be your father
                     Cuz you worked so much harder
                     And you are so much smarter
                     Then I was at your age."
                     And I always knew
                     That she would fly away
                     That she was gonna change the world someday
                     I will not be the reason that my family can't succeed
                     I will do what it takes
                     They'll have everything they need
                     Or all my work, all my life
                     Everything I've sacrificed will have been useless


Gorgeous!

                     I bet you impressed them all out west;
                     You were always the best, no doubt!
                     We want front row seats to your graduation...
                     They'll call your name...
                     And we'll scream and shout!
                     You guys, I dropped out.
                     No me diga?!
                     I should go.
                     That's a shitty piece of news.
                     That girl never quit anything.
                     What the hell happened?
                     I don't know..

                             If I won the lotto tomorrow
                             Well I know
                             I wouldn't bother going on no spending spree
                             I'd pick a business school and pay the entrance fee
                             Then maybe, if you're lucky, you'll stay friends with me.
                             I'll be a business man,
                             Richer than Nina's daddy,
                             Donald Trump and I on the links,
                             And he's my caddy
                             My money's making money, I'm going from po' to moto
                             Keep the bling, I want the brass ring like Frodo!

                             It's gonna get hot and heavy and you're already sweaty-
                             Y-y-yo-yo
                             Yo, I'm sorry, is that an answer?
                             Shut up, go home and pull your damn pants up!
                             As for you, Mr. Frodo of the shire, 96 gs ain't enough to retire
                             Come on, I'll have enough to knock your ass of its axis!
                             You'll have a knapsack full of jack after taxes!
                             96, 000
                             Ay, alabanza!
                             96, 000
                             No me diga!
                             96, 000
                             I never win shit!
                             96, 000
                             For real, though,
                             Imagine how it would feel going real slow
                             Down the highway of life
                             With no regrets
                             And no breaking your neck for respect or a paycheck
                             For real, though, I'll take a break from the wheel
                             And we'll throw the biggest block party, everybody here
                             It's a weekend when we can breathe, take it easy
                             Yo! ma, it's me, check my tickets!
                             Check one two three what would you do with 96 gs?
                             Who, me?
                             I mean, if it's just between you and me-
                             Esa pregunta es tricky!
                             I know!
                             With 96 gs,
                             I'd start my life with a brand new lease
                             Atlantic city with a malibu breeze
                             And a brand new weave-
                             Or maybe just bleach...
                             Y'all are freaks
                             Yo, I'm just sayin...
                             It's silly when we get into
                             These crazy hypotheticals
                             You really want some bread
                             Then go ahead, create a set of goals
                             And cross them off the list as you pursue them
                             And with those 96 I know precisely what I'm doing
                             What you doing?
                             What am I doing? What am I doing?
                             It takes most of that cash just to save my ass from financial ruin
                             Sonny can keep the coffee brewin'
                             I'll spend a few on you
                             Cause the only room with a view's a room with you in it
                             And I could give Abuela Claudia the rest of it
                             Just fly me down to Puerta Plata, I'll make the best of it
                             You really love this business?
                             No
                             Tough, Merry Christmas
                             You're now the youngest tycoon in Washington Hiznits
                             Yo, with 96, 000, I'd finally fix housing
                             Give the barrio computers and wireless web browsing
                             Your kids are living without a good edumacation change the station,
                             Teach them about gentrification, the rent is escalating (what?)
                             The rich are penetrating (what?)
                             We pay our corporations
                             When we should be demonstrating (what?)
                             What about immigration? (what?)
                             Politicians be hating (what?)
                             Racism in this nation's gone
                             From latent to blatent!
                             OOOH!
                             I'll cash my ticket and picket
                             Invest in protest
                             Never lose my focus 'til the
                             City takes notice
                             And you know this, man!
                             I'll never sleep
                             Because the ghetto has a million promises for me to keep!
                             You are so cute!
                             I was just thinking off the top of my head.
                             96k go
                             If I win the lottery
                             You'll never see me again.

                             I'll get out of the barrio
                             For real, though (If I win the lottery)
                             Imagine how it would feel
                             Goin' real slow
                             Down the highway of life (You'll wonder where I've been)
                             With no regrets
                             And no breakin' your neck for respect
