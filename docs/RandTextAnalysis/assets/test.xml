                             Damn...
                             96, 000
                             Dollers? Holla.
                             96, 000
                             Yo, somebody won!
                             96, 000
                             Yo...
                             If I won the lotto tomorrow
                             Well I know
                             I wouldn't bother going on no spending spree
                             I'd pick a business school and pay the entrance fee
                             Then maybe, if you're lucky, you'll stay friends with me.
                             I'll be a business man,
                             Richer than Nina's daddy,
                             Donald Trump and I on the links,
                             And he's my caddy
                             My money's making money, I'm going from po' to moto
                             Keep the bling, I want the brass ring like Frodo!
                             Oh no, there goes Mr. Braggadocio
                             Next thing you know, you're lying like Pinnochio
                             Well if you're scared of the bull, stay out of the rodeo!
                             Yo, I got more hoes than a phone book in tokyo!
                             Ooh, you'd better stop rappin'
                             You're not ready
                             It's gonna get hot and heavy and you're already sweaty-
                             Y-y-yo-yo
                             Yo, I'm sorry, is that an answer?
                             Shut up, go home and pull your damn pants up!
                             As for you, Mr. Frodo of the shire, 96 gs ain't enough to retire
                             Come on, I'll have enough to knock your ass of its axis!
                             You'll have a knapsack full of jack after taxes!
                             96, 000
                             Ay, alabanza!
                             96, 000
                             No me diga!
                             96, 000
                             I never win shit!
                             96, 000
                             For real, though,
                             Imagine how it would feel going real slow
                             Down the highway of life
                             With no regrets
                             And no breaking your neck for respect or a paycheck
                             For real, though, I'll take a break from the wheel
                             And we'll throw the biggest block party, everybody here
                             It's a weekend when we can breathe, take it easy
                             Yo! ma, it's me, check my tickets!
                             Check one two three what would you do with 96 gs?
                             Who, me?
                             I mean, if it's just between you and me-
                             Esa pregunta es tricky!
                             I know!
                             With 96 gs,
                             I'd start my life with a brand new lease
                             Atlantic city with a malibu breeze
                             And a brand new weave-
                             Or maybe just bleach...
                             Y'all are freaks
                             Yo, I'm just sayin...
                             It's silly when we get into
                             These crazy hypotheticals
                             You really want some bread
                             Then go ahead, create a set of goals
                             And cross them off the list as you pursue them
                             And with those 96 I know precisely what I'm doing
                             What you doing?
                             What am I doing? What am I doing?
                             It takes most of that cash just to save my ass from financial ruin
                             Sonny can keep the coffee brewin'
                             I'll spend a few on you
                             Cause the only room with a view's a room with you in it
                             And I could give Abuela Claudia the rest of it
                             Just fly me down to Puerta Plata, I'll make the best of it
                             You really love this business?
                             No
                             Tough, Merry Christmas
                             You're now the youngest tycoon in Washington Hiznits
                             Yo, with 96, 000, I'd finally fix housing
                             Give the barrio computers and wireless web browsing
                             Your kids are living without a good edumacation change the station,
                             Teach them about gentrification, the rent is escalating (what?)
                             The rich are penetrating (what?)
                             We pay our corporations
                             When we should be demonstrating (what?)
                             What about immigration? (what?)
                             Politicians be hating (what?)
                             Racism in this nation's gone
                             From latent to blatent!
                             OOOH!
                             I'll cash my ticket and picket
                             Invest in protest
                             Never lose my focus 'til the
                             City takes notice
                             And you know this, man!
                             I'll never sleep
                             Because the ghetto has a million promises for me to keep!
                             You are so cute!
                             I was just thinking off the top of my head.
                             96k go
                             If I win the lottery
                             You'll never see me again.
                             Damn, we only jokin
                             Stay broke, then!
                             I'll be downtown
                             Get a nice studio
                             I'll get out of the barrio
                             For real, though (If I win the lottery)
                             Imagine how it would feel
                             Goin' real slow
                             Down the highway of life (You'll wonder where I've been)
                             With no regrets
                             And no breakin' your neck for respect
                             Or a paycheck -
                             It's silly when we get into these crazy hypotheticals, (I'll be downtown)
                             You really want some bread then go ahead,
                             Create a set of goals and cross them off the list as you pursue em', (see you around)
                             And with those 96 I know precisely what I'm doing!
                             Check one two three (If I win the lottery)
                             And with the Dollah Dollah
                             With 96 g's
                             We get to hollah hollah
                             Between you and me (you won't see a lot of me!)
                             We rock the hot impala
                             Why-hoo!
                             With 96 g's (I'll be downtown)

                             We could pay off the debts we owe!
                             We could tell every one we know!
                             I could get on a plane and go
                             We'd be swimmin in dough, yo
