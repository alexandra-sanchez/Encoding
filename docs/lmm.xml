                             Damn...
                             96, 000
                             Dollers? Holla.
                             96, 000
                             Yo, somebody won!
                             96, 000
                             Yo...
                             If I won the lotto tomorrow
                             Well I know
                             I wouldn't bother going on no spending spree
                             I'd pick a business school and pay the entrance fee
                             Then maybe, if you're lucky, you'll stay friends with me.
                             I'll be a business man,
                             Richer than Nina's daddy,
                             Donald Trump and I on the links,
                             And he's my caddy
                             My money's making money, I'm going from po' to moto
                             Keep the bling, I want the brass ring like Frodo!
                             Oh no, there goes Mr. Braggadocio
                             Next thing you know, you're lying like Pinnochio
                             Well if you're scared of the bull, stay out of the rodeo!
                             Yo, I got more hoes than a phone book in tokyo!
                             Ooh, you'd better stop rappin'
                             You're not ready
                             It's gonna get hot and heavy and you're already sweaty-
                             Y-y-yo-yo
                             Yo, I'm sorry, is that an answer?
                             Shut up, go home and pull your damn pants up!
                             As for you, Mr. Frodo of the shire, 96 gs ain't enough to retire
                             Come on, I'll have enough to knock your ass of its axis!
                             You'll have a knapsack full of jack after taxes!
                             96, 000
                             Ay, alabanza!
                             96, 000
                             No me diga!
                             96, 000
                             I never win shit!
                             96, 000
                             For real, though,
                             Imagine how it would feel going real slow
                             Down the highway of life
                             With no regrets
                             And no breaking your neck for respect or a paycheck
                             For real, though, I'll take a break from the wheel
                             And we'll throw the biggest block party, everybody here
                             It's a weekend when we can breathe, take it easy
                             Yo! ma, it's me, check my tickets!
                             Check one two three what would you do with 96 gs?
                             Who, me?
                             I mean, if it's just between you and me-
                             Esa pregunta es tricky!
                             I know!
                             With 96 gs,
                             I'd start my life with a brand new lease
                             Atlantic city with a malibu breeze
                             And a brand new weave-
                             Or maybe just bleach...
                             Y'all are freaks
                             Yo, I'm just sayin...
                             It's silly when we get into
                             These crazy hypotheticals
                             You really want some bread
                             Then go ahead, create a set of goals
                             And cross them off the list as you pursue them
                             And with those 96 I know precisely what I'm doing
                             What you doing?
                             What am I doing? What am I doing?
                             It takes most of that cash just to save my ass from financial ruin
                             Sonny can keep the coffee brewin'
                             I'll spend a few on you
                             Cause the only room with a view's a room with you in it
                             And I could give Abuela Claudia the rest of it
                             Just fly me down to Puerta Plata, I'll make the best of it
                             You really love this business?
                             No
                             Tough, Merry Christmas
                             You're now the youngest tycoon in Washington Hiznits
                             Yo, with 96, 000, I'd finally fix housing
                             Give the barrio computers and wireless web browsing
                             Your kids are living without a good edumacation change the station,
                             Teach them about gentrification, the rent is escalating (what?)
                             The rich are penetrating (what?)
                             We pay our corporations
                             When we should be demonstrating (what?)
                             What about immigration? (what?)
                             Politicians be hating (what?)
                             Racism in this nation's gone
                             From latent to blatent!
                             OOOH!
                             I'll cash my ticket and picket
                             Invest in protest
                             Never lose my focus 'til the
                             City takes notice
                             And you know this, man!
                             I'll never sleep
                             Because the ghetto has a million promises for me to keep!
                             You are so cute!
                             I was just thinking off the top of my head.
                             96k go
                             If I win the lottery
                             You'll never see me again.
                             Damn, we only jokin
                             Stay broke, then!
                             I'll be downtown
                             Get a nice studio
                             I'll get out of the barrio
                             For real, though (If I win the lottery)
                             Imagine how it would feel
                             Goin' real slow
                             Down the highway of life (You'll wonder where I've been)
                             With no regrets
                             And no breakin' your neck for respect
                             Or a paycheck -
                             It's silly when we get into these crazy hypotheticals, (I'll be downtown)
                             You really want some bread then go ahead,
                             Create a set of goals and cross them off the list as you pursue em', (see you around)

                             And with the Dollah Dollah

                             Between you and me (you won't see a lot of me!)
                             We rock the hot impala
                             Why-hoo!

                             We could tell every one we know!
                             I could get on a plane and go
                             We'd be swimmin in dough, yo

                 <p><She was found and pronounced... at the scene
                     She was already lying in bed
                     The paramedics said
                     That her heart gave out
                     I mean, that's basically what they said
                     They said a combination of the stress and the heat
                     Why she never took her medicine, I'll never understand
                     I'd like to think she went out in peace
                     With pieces of bread crumbs in her hand
                     Abuela Claudia had simple pleasures
                     She sang the praises of things we ignore
                     Glass Coke bottles, bread crumbs, a sky full of stars
                     She cherished these things, she'd say: "Alabanza"
                     Alabanza means to raise this
                     Thing to God's face
                     And to sing, quite literally: "Praise to this"
                     When she was here, the path was clear
                     And she was just here, she was just here
                     Alabanza

                     They regard me with pride
                     And everyone's sweet
                     They say, "You're going places!"
                     So how can I say that while I was away, I had so much to hide!

                     As the radio plays old forgotten boleros
                     I think of the days when this city was mine
                     I remember the praise
                     Ay, te adoro, te quiero
                     The neighborhood waved, and said
                     Nina, be brave, and you're gonna be fine
                     And maybe it's me
                     But it seems like lifetimes ago
                     So what do I say to these faces that I used to know?
                     "Hey, I'm home?"
                     Mira, Nina
                     Hey
                     No me preocupo por ella
                     They're not worried about me
                     Mira, alli esta nuestra estrella
                     They are all counting on me to succeed
                     I am the one who made it out
                     The one who always made the grade
                     But maybe I should've just stayed home...
                     When I was a child I stayed wide awake, climbed to the highest place
                     On every fire escape, restless to climb
                     (Underneath Nina (above)) Ella si da la talla
                     Repira
                     I got every scholarship
                     Saved every dollar
                     The first to go to college
                     How do I tell them why
                     I'm coming back home
                     With my eyes on the horizon
                     Just me and the GWB
                     Asking 'Gee Nina, what'll you be?'
                     Straighten the spine
                     Smile for the neighbors
                     Everything's fine
                     Everything's cool
                     The standard reply
                     "Lots of tests, lots of papers"
                     Smile, wave goodbye
                     And pray to the sky, Oh, God -
                     What will my parents say?
                     Nina
                     Can I go in there and say
                     Nina
                     "I know that I'm letting you down..."
                     Nina...

                     What's this tontería that I'm seeing on the street?
                     I never thought I'd see the day...
                     Since when are Latin people scared of heat?
                     When I was a little girl
                     Growing up in the hills of Vega Alta
                     My favorite time of year was Christmas time
                     Ask me why
                     Why?
                     There wasn't an ounce of snow
                     But, oh, the coquito would flow
                     As we sang the aguinaldo
                     The carnaval would begin to grow
                     Business is closed

                     I have a question
                     I don't know what you're cantando
                     Just make it up as you go
                     We are improvisando
                     Lai le lo lai lo le lo lai
                     You can sing anything
                     What?
                     Carla, whatever comes into your head
                     Just so long as you sing
                     Ummm...
                     My mom is Dominican-Cuban
                     My dad is from Chile and P.R.
                     Which means:
                     I'm Chile-...Dominica-Rican!
                     But I always say I'm from Queens!

                     I gotta get out of here soon
                     This block's getting worse by the hour
                     You can't even go to the club with a friend
                     Without having somebody shove you
                     Ay, por favor
                     Vanessa don't pretend that Usnavi's your friend
                     We all know that he love you!
                     Well, now that you mention that sexual tension
                     It's easy to see!

                 <p><So I got you a present
                     I went downtown to get it
                     You doing anything tonight?
                     Cleaning
                     You're done for the day
                     No way
                     'Cause we got a date
                     Okay
                     Before you board that plane
                     I owe you a bottle of cold champagne
                     No
                     Yeah, cold champagne
                     Damn, the bottle's all sweaty and everything
                     You went and got this?
                     Pop the champagne
                     I don't know if we have coffee cups
                     Or plastic cups
                     I think Sonny has the cups-
                     Tonight we're drinking straight from the bottle
                     Usnavi?
                     Yeah?
                     Daniela told me what you did for me
                     And it's honestly the sweetest thing anyone ever did for me
                     Now what can I say or do to possibly repay you for your kindness?
                     How do you get this gold shit off?
                     Usnavi!
                     Yeah!
                     Before we both leave town
                     Before the corner changes
                     And the signs are taken down
                     Let's walk around the neighborhood and say our goodbyes
                     Usnavi, are you alright?
                     I'm fine, I'm tryin'a open this champagne
                     See the twisty thing is broken
                     But I'm gonna open this damn champagne
                     Let me see it
                     No, I got it
                     Yo, Usnavi, drop the champagne
                     I mean you went to all this trouble to get us a little bubbly-
                     And it's gonna be okay
                     I'm sorry, it's been a long day
                     You oughta stay
                     What?
                     You can use that money to fix this place
                     Ha ha, very funny
                     And it's not like Sonny's got role models-
                     Role models?
                     Stepping up to the plate
                     Yo, what are you talking about?
                     I'm just saying, I think your vacation can wait
                     Vacation? Vanessa, you're leaving too
                     I'm going down to West 4th Street
                     You can take the A
                     What are you trying to say?
                     You're leaving the country and we're never gonna see you again
                     What are you trying to say?
                     You get everyone addicted to your coffee and off you go
                     Vanessa, I don't know why you're mad at me
                     I wish I was mad.
                     I'm just too late.></p>
